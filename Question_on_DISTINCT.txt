QUESTION ON DISTINCT

I believe that using SELECT DISTINCT in this context is the correct approach and will retrieve the information required.
By using SELECT DISTINCT with the first and last name you guarantee that each record will be an individual person.
This SQL statement can return multiple records of the same name in either first or last name, 
but the combination of the two columns will never return a multiple full name. 

Example 1

First Name could return  Last Name could return

David				Diaz
David 				Dunne
David				Spain

Example 2

First Name could return  Last Name could return

David				Kohlmann
John				Kohlmann
Steve				Kohlmann

SELECT returns 847 records (people in this case) and leaves ambiguity to how how many customers are actually in the table. 
SELECT DISTINCT returns 440 records (people) and this lets the client know exactly how many customers are in the database.
